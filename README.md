## Features
1. Support PDF, MS word, and text files.
2. Extract important information such as skills, education, experiences, email, phone number, etc.
3. Process multiple files at the same time.
4. Saving the data in [JSON file](https://github.com/tramyardg/CVparser/blob/master/public/candidates.json).
5. Saving the date in [CSV file](https://github.com/tramyardg/CVparser/blob/master/public/candidates.csv).

### Regular expression
Regular expression was used to extract a section of a resume. This is because an experience section might 
contain multiple instances of the word experience. 
Therefore, a strict regular expression for extracting experience section must be used.
The solution was to get the index of the word experience 
that matches exactly to the following
```Java
 EXPERIENCE ("\\b(Experience(s?)|EXPERIENCE(S?))\\b")
```
This excluded lowercase experience or experiences. The same notion applies to other section headings.
